## This project is an implementation of [Masudur Rahman's design](https://dribbble.com/uigeek/projects/983583-Music-Desktop-App).

## [Live Preview](https://skaralius.github.io/implementing-design/)

The point of the project was to work with a design and to implement it correctly, staying true to the spirit of it, as well as, practice and learn how to implement some of the more
curious design elements, for example the background fade-out effect behind the albums 
or the grainy texture to liven up and give some depth to the background.

Thanks to Masudur Rahman for letting me use his design in this project.
